# Multi-model Intercomparison Project on the Saskatchewan-Nelson-Churchill River Basin (Nelson-MiP) 
# Objectives 
The objectives of this research project led by HC-HAL on a sub-watershed of the Saskatchewan-Nelson-Churchill river basin are to: 
1. compare participating hydrologic and land surface models with respect to their performance in reproducing long-term runoff and various hydrologic signatures; 
2. understand the drivers of the differences among models from an internal process perspective; 
3. assess the realism of different algorithms in simulating the same processes; 
4. assess the reliability of the models for the prediction of key hydrologic processes and streamflow under changing climate conditions. 
5. develop robust ensemble averaging methods to reduce the range of uncertainties in streamflow projection under changing climate conditions.
